# Introduction to Data Communication

## Basics of Data Communication

**Data communication** refers to the exchange of data between two or more devices through a transmission medium such as cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals. The goal is to deliver information accurately and efficiently from a sender to a receiver.

For communication to occur successfully, several fundamental elements must work together.

### Components of a Data Communication System

1. **Message**
   The information being communicated. It can be text, numbers, images, audio, or video.

2. **Sender (Source)**
   The device that sends the message. Examples include computers, smartphones, sensors, or servers.

3. **Receiver (Destination)**
   The device that receives the message. Like the sender, it can be a computer, mobile device, or another digital system.

4. **Transmission Medium**
   The physical or wireless path through which the message travels. Examples include twisted-pair cables, fiber optics, radio waves, and satellite links.

5. **Protocol**
   A set of rules governing data communication. Protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and acknowledged. Without protocols, devices cannot understand each other.

## Data Representation

Data must be converted into a form suitable for transmission. Common forms include:

- **Text** – Represented using encoding standards such as **ASCII** or Unicode
- **Numbers** – Converted into binary form
- **Images** – Represented as matrices of pixels
- **Audio** – Converted into digital signals through sampling
- **Video** – A sequence of images with synchronized audio

## Characteristics of Effective Data Communication

For a communication system to be effective, it must meet certain criteria:

- **Delivery** – Data must reach the correct destination
- **Accuracy** – Data must arrive without errors
- **Timeliness** – Data must arrive when needed (especially critical for real-time applications)
- **Low Jitter** – Variations in packet arrival time should be minimal, important for audio/video transmission

## Data Flow Directions

Data can flow in different ways between communicating devices:

- **Simplex** – One-way communication only (e.g., keyboard to computer)
- **Half-Duplex** – Two-way communication, but not at the same time (e.g., walkie-talkies)
- **Full-Duplex** – Two-way simultaneous communication (e.g., phone calls)
